This repository is not maintained anymore!
==========================================

The CAN firmware has been merged into [udriver_firmware](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/udriver_firmware)  and will be maintained there from now on.

See the [documentation of udriver_firmware](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/udriver_firmware)

Dual Motor Torque Control
=========================

Firmware for the [Open Robot Actuator Motor Boards](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware)
using comunication via CAN.

This firmware allows torque control of two motors at once using communication
via CAN.  Use this firmware when you want to connect a TI LaunchPad evaluation
board or a BLMC ÂµDriver board via CAN.  If you want to communicate via Ethernet,
using a Master Board, use [this firmware](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/udriver_firmware)
instead.

This program can be used with the Universal Dual Motor GUI.


Hardware
--------

This project is configured for use with the LAUNCHXL-F28069M microcontroller
board and two DRV8305 booster packs.
